In my spare time, I am a part of voluntary organizations of Google and IBM, which aim to help young minds get involved in Technology and unintuitive concepts like Quantum Computing. This involves training them in software development and key technical processes.
I also create Mobile Apps for both Android and iOS, most of which are games and software solutions to real-life situations. Currently my Playstore account has 5,000+ downloads with 20+ production ready applications and Appstore account has around 1,000 downloads.
Always interested in Web, Android & iOS Development roles and have a keen interest in Quantum Computing.
