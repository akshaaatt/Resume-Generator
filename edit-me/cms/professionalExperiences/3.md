As a Software Development Engineer at Avataar, I have made a significant impact by developing advanced iOS and web applications. I have utilized cutting-edge technologies such as SwiftUI, ARKit, SceneKit, React, Next.js, MongoDB, AWS, Firebase, Lottie, Alamofire, Jenkins, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, JavaScript, MaterialUI, Jest tests, Three.js, and react-three-fiber, WebGL to build apps that are both reliable and user-friendly.

In the iOS app, I implemented the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture with Dependency Injection and integrated features such as onboarding, object scanning, and push notifications. The app enables users to generate 3D models within 30 minutes and view them on the app.

In the web application, I developed a CMS platform for clients like CrateAndBarrel, Nike, Wayfair and Lowe's. The platform gives clients the ability to manage the output of their 3D scans, download the mesh equivalent, and perform last-mile editing on their 3D models using an editor and post-training interface.

Throughout my time at Avataar, I have demonstrated my technical expertise, attention to detail, and ability to work effectively in a team. I have played a crucial role in delivering high-quality products that meet the needs of end-users and clients. My work has helped to establish Avataar as a leader in the field of 3D scanning and has laid the foundation for future growth and success.
